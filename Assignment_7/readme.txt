This is a Sass code snippet, a preprocessor scripting language that is compiled into CSS. Sass provides a way to write more efficient and maintainable CSS code by adding functionality that is not available in CSS, such as variables, mixins, functions, and nesting.

The code snippet includes the following Sass features:

Variables: declared using the $ symbol, used to store and reuse values throughout the stylesheet.

Custom properties: declared using the :root selector, used to define global variables that can be used anywhere in the stylesheet using the var() function.

Mixins: declared using the @mixin directive, used to group a set of CSS declarations that can be reused throughout the stylesheet using the @include directive.

Functions: declared using the @function directive, used to perform calculations and return values that can be used in CSS declarations.

Placeholder selectors: declared using the % symbol, used to define a set of CSS rules that can be reused throughout the stylesheet using the @extend directive.

Nesting: used to write more concise and readable CSS code by nesting selectors and declarations inside other selectors.

The code snippet defines variables for the primary, secondary, light, and dark colors, as well as the font family. It also defines custom properties for the background color, text color, primary color, and secondary color.

The button-style mixin is defined to apply a set of styles to buttons, and the calculate-width function is defined to calculate the width of an element based on its container.

The %title and %card placeholder selectors are defined to reuse a set of CSS rules for titles and cards, respectively.

The code snippet also includes examples of nesting, such as the header and nav sections for the website header and the main section for the website content.

This is a Sass file which contains styles for a website. Sass is a preprocessor scripting language that is compiled into CSS. It offers features like variables, nesting, and mixins that make writing CSS more efficient and organized.

The variables at the top of the file define three colors that are used throughout the website. The global styles apply to the entire website, including the font family, background color, and container layout.

The header section includes a background color, padding, and a h1 tag with centered text that has a shadow effect. The navigation links are displayed to the right using flexbox.

The hero section includes an image that is resized to fit within its container.

The categories section includes a background color, padding, and a list of links styled to change the text color and underline on hover.

The menu sections include a background color, padding, and a list of menu items with images and details that are styled using flexbox.

The pastries section includes a dark background color and a grid of cards that display pastries with images, titles, descriptions, and prices.

The sandwiches section includes a light background color and a list of sandwiches with images, titles, descriptions, and prices.
