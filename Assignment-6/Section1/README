Project Features
The form validates the email field to ensure it starts with only characters and ends with northeastern.edu.
The form validates the username field to ensure the length is between 3-10 characters only.
The form validates the password field to ensure it contains at least one special character, a number, a lowercase letter, and an uppercase letter.
Error messages are displayed in real-time as soon as the input is detected as invalid.
Upon successful validation, the form redirects to a new page (calc.html).
